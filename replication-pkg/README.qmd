This template should be used in conjuction with [Unofficial guidance on various topics by Social Science Data Editors](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/). Some example text and tables are from [A template README for social science replication packages](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/). Aims to satisfy requirements in @koren2022

## Overview

The code in this replication package constructs the analysis file from the three data sources (Ruggles et al, 2018; Inglehart et al, 2019; BEA, 2016) using Stata and Julia. Two main files run all of the code to generate the data for the 15 figures and 3 tables in the paper. The replicator should expect the code to run for about 14 hours.

## Files

### Dataset List

All dataset files can be found in `data` in the following subfolders:

- `data/raw/` contains raw datafiles and codebooks
- `data/interim/` is generated by the main script to store intermediate data outputs
- `data/analysis/` contains all data used in the main analysis

| Dataset.File | Codebook | Data.Source.ID | Notes    |Provided |
|-----------|--------|----------|---------|-------|
| `data/raw/lbd.dta` | `data/raw/lbd-codebook.pdf`| LBD | Confidential | No |
| `data/raw/terra.dta` | IPUMS Terra | As per terms of use | Yes |
| `data/analysis/regression_input.dta`| All listed | Combines multiple data sources, serves as input for Table 2, 3 and Figure 5. | Yes |

### Code/Program Details

All code can be found in the folder `code`

| Code.File | Notes |
|-----------|--------|
|`00_setup/main-setup.do`||
|`00_setup/download-data.sh`| bash script for downloading datasets|
|`01_dataprep/main.do`| main replication script|

### Summary Instructions

- Edit `code/config.do` to adjust the default path
- Run `code/00_setup/main-setup.do` once on a new system to set up the working environment. 
- Download the data files referenced above. Each should be stored in the prepared subdirectories of `data/`, in the format that you download them in. Do not unzip. Scripts are provided in each directory to download the public-use files. Confidential data files requested as part of your FSRDC project will appear in the `/data` folder. No further action is needed on the replicator's part.
- Run `programs/01_main.do` to run all steps in sequence.

### Pipeline Details

- `code/00_setup/main-setup.do`: will create all output directories, install needed ado packages. 
   - If wishing to update the ado packages used by this archive, change the parameter `update_ado` to `yes`. However, this is not needed to successfully reproduce the manuscript tables. 
- `code/01_dataprep/`:  
   - These programs were last run at various times in 2018. 
   - Order does not matter, all programs can be run in parallel, if needed. 
   - A `code/01_dataprep/main.do` will run them all in sequence, which should take about 2 hours.
- `code/02_analysis/main.do`.
   - If running programs individually, note that ORDER IS IMPORTANT. 
   - The programs were last run top to bottom on July 4, 2019.
- `code/03_appendix/main-appendix.do`. The programs were last run top to bottom on July 4, 2019.

### Tables and Figures

The provided code reproduces:

- [ ] All numbers provided in text in the paper

- Figure 1: The figure can be reproduced using the data provided in the folder “2_data/data_map”, and ArcGIS Desktop (Version 10.7.1) by following these (manual) instructions:
  - Create a new map document in ArcGIS ArcMap, browse to the folder
“2_data/data_map” in the “Catalog”, with files  "provinceborders.shp", "lakes.shp", and "cities.shp". 
  - Drop the files listed above onto the new map, creating three separate layers. Order them with "lakes" in the top layer and "cities" in the bottom layer.
  - Right-click on the cities file, in properties choose the variable "health"... (more details)
